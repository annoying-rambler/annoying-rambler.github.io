**Disclaimer**: I'm not a health professional. I'm just a random person over the Internet...

Looking back on my first few weeks in my new role.

I was hit hard by anxiety, and my stress levels were off the charts. I guess I found myself caught up in that _Impostor Syndrome_ stuff.

For those who don't know what _Impostor Syndrome_ is:

> **Impostor syndrome**, also known as **impostor phenomenon** or **impostorism**, is a psychological thing where people doubt their skills, talents, or accomplishments and have this ongoing fear that they'll be exposed as total frauds.

Despite receiving comments like "You did good during the interviews, you're good to go," I just can't fully buy into it. There's this voice in my head that won't quit, saying things like:

- _"You're not supposed to be here..."_
- _"This is not your thing..."_
- _"Maybe you don't have what it takes to stick around..."_
- _"They're gonna figure out they goofed up..."_
- _"You probably look/sound dumb..."_

And as I'm writing this post, I feel like an impostor writing it.

The hard part about this is that these feelings create a blur between "not liking it" and being "scared of it". I'm not sure which is which.

In the end, I don't know what the future holds. I'm still not convinced I've got the right level of skills for this job. I guess only time will tell if this is a good fit for me. 

What's important though, is that while being on the job, I try to keep those things in mind:

- Stress is unavoidable. I let it flow through me without (too much of) a fight...
- Honesty is the only way forward...
- Some days are good, some days are bad. That's life...
- Question? Write it down. Answer? Write it down also. Just write things down...
- Don't need to be "superpumped". Friendly and casual is enough... 
- It's a job. No more, no less...

<p></p>
Writing things down frees the mind and I was tired of keeping this in my mind. So there you go blog post!

Ending on an unexpected positive note (at least for me), getting older does bring clarity into this whole thing. I find it easier to deal with these feelings as I'm growing older.
Maybe that's the secret power of white hair?

I hope you get some benefits from knowing that you are not alone going through this and that there's always people willing to help.

Cheers,
