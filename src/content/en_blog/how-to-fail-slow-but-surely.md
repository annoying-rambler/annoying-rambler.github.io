Are you wondering how to burn your investors' money? Are you looking for the secret sauce to go bankrupt?

If this sounds like you, look no further; here are 3 very efficient tricks to ensure that you fail slowly, but surely.

##### Make sure your vision is blurry

This creates confusion among your teams when having to make decisions. Using the blurry vision trick, you'll ensure that your team is never able to make quick and educated decisions that fit with the bigger picture.

Make sure there is no big picture. Actions should be a series of misguided random steps. This will ensure that over time, you'll make very little progress, always canceling any gain you could have had with a new contradictory decision. 

Genius.

##### Make sure you separate teams as much as possible

Different teams should not work together. You should instead make sure that each team is highly specialized in a single part of your system.

This will ensure that the output of a single team will hardly be usable by other teams. Thus, forcing constant refactoring and last-minute changes.

Over time, this will create a culture where each team will focus only on their specific goals and outcomes, overshadowing the benefits they need to bring to the overall system.

##### Make sure your decision-makers are uncompromising and ego-driven

Having ego-driven leaders will ensure that your organization stays separated. Ego-driven contributors will constantly blame others, creating a culture of mistrust and information hoarding.

A strong emphasis should be put on recruiting ego-driven contributors with high academic or professional credentials. They are especially efficient at demolishing any worldview that doesn't match their own.

An interesting side-effect to this is that they create the impossibility for a company to quickly pivot and change direction. Those individuals will never admit fault, nor will they perform any sort of introspection which is required to kickstart the pivot process.

##### Bonus: If you have scientists in-house, make sure they never see real-world data. Only toy datasets.

(This one is very specific; it might not apply to your organization)

In Act 1, this will ensure they will spend years of research optimizing their algorithms for data sets that have almost no bearing in reality. Ensuring the failure of any project when faced with real-world messy data.

During Act 2, in combination with the other methods, it creates a thick veil of shadow where quarters after quarters your research team will be able to display what looks like improvements, giving them the illusion that they are making progress.

The final act will take place when the curtain is drawn back, revealing the ugly reality. By effectively implementing the aforementioned methods, you will guarantee that attention is diverted towards manipulating figures and engaging in futile debates about responsibility and the delayed revelation of these issues.

##### TLDR

To ensure the success of the failure of your company, make sure to:

- Lack vision
- Separate teams as much as possible
- Hire ego-driven and uncompromising leaders
- Bonus: Scientists should NEVER have access to useful real-world data
