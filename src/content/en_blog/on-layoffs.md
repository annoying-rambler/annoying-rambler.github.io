I got laid off a few months ago. First time.

It was a shock at first, especially since I had been working there for half a decade. With hindsight, it wasn't entirely a surprise since I was working for a startup company and we had been in serious difficulties with product-market fit since, well..., the beginning.

It gave me a cold and hard reality check about the workplace in general.

The first thing is that no one is essential. You might think that you're the only one who knows X, Y, Z, therefore they can't fire you. Wrong. They can and they will whenever they need to.

When the decision is already taken, there's no room for negotiation. It doesn't matter how many years you've spent there or if it's a bad time for you to be let go. It's over. It's your last day, take your stuff and leave.

At first, it may sound cruel, but it is liberating.

It is liberating because it works both ways. If this is something they can do to you, after all the time you've spent there, well, it's definitely something that any other employer can do as well.

This means that you are free. Free to jump on any new opportunity you might encounter without feeling any remorse. This also means that when it's time to negotiate about work conditions, go fetch that inner selfishness demon of yours; it's time to use it.

Is it something that I want? Absolutely not. Most people hate change, and let me tell you I'm like most people. I wish I could have stayed my entire career at the same place and not have to worry about all this.

Unfortunately, I don't have any say in this.

It is what it is.

At the end of the day, I'm only talking about being laid off. Nothing too serious. It sucks, I'm pissed, my ego was bruised, but I'll get over it eventually. Hopefully sooner than later.
